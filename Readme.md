# 42block

This is my zmk config for my handwired 42 key monoblock travel board designed to rest on top of a laptop comfortably without pressing any keys 
underneath it.  It prints in two solid chunks that are glued together.  Its thick enough that keys will not protrude up so that it can be flipped over and stuffed in a bag facing the laptop.
